## Description

Generates a README template based off of user input. Uses the npm "inquirer" package to solicit input and then formats that content into a README to avoid having to do the basics of README generation repeatedly for each project.

A sample README generated with this tool is present in the "output" folder (also where new README files will be generated, overwriting any existing files)
